= Hereâ€™s what you get with WPNewsman for WordPress: =

* **Effortless installation and configuration**.
You can use our plugin rigth out-of-box. WPNewsman is pre-configured to collect the subscribers' email addresses and names and have them confirm their subscription. It's supplied with system email templates and action pages used in the double opt-in process. You can modify the default settings as you like or use them as is.

* **Quick signup widget & forms**.
You can collect email subscribers either from the sidebar widget or shortcode-supported double opt-in forms. You can customize the signup form as you like by adding fields or options, removing fields, re-ordering fields. You can embed opt-in forms anywhere on your WordPress site and create multiple mailing lists using different forms.

* **Easy customization of the Welcome Email and Thank You page after subscription confirmation**.
Though the Confirmation Email and Welcome Message are supplied with the plugin, you can fully customize them through your admin panel to fit your marketing needs. For example, you can include a link to a file in your server into the welcome message as a bonus for signing up. Also you can customize default action pages including the Thank You page as you like.

* **Easy mailing list management**.
You can import your existing subscribers into your WordPress database and export collected subscribers to a file. You can manually unsubscribe users, delete users or change the subscriber's status to confirmed or unconfirmed.

* **Ability to quickly re-send a confirmation request**.
You can quickly segment your list, select only those who haven't validated their email address yet and re-send them a confirmation email. This is also a great opportunity to re-engage your existing subscribers collected from other sources. You can import them into your WordPress database and send them a confirmation request.

* **Full control over email newsletter design**.
You have unlimited customization options (body, header, footer, colors etc.) for built-in email templates including the mobile template. Plus, you can design your own email newsletter either choosing from different layouts, or using a quick message option (without using any template) to built a newsletter that resembles your marketing material. In addition, you can easily create a digest template to send blog posts notifications to your subscribers.

* **Multiple sending options**.
You can customize From name, From email address and Return email address and choose the suitable delivery mode including your custom SMTP server or quickly load Gmail or Amazon SES SMTP settings. You can send newsletters immediately or schedule them at any date or time and throttle email newsletter sending to respect the SMTP server restrictions.

* **Confirmation when the user unsubscribes**.
Sometimes it's a big problem. The users send newsletters to friends and the friend can unsubscribe them by clicking the unsubscribe link. So, people often find themselves unsubscribed through they've never sent an unsubscribe request. With the WPNewsman you can send an unsubscribe notification via email to the user to ensure the person really wants to unsubscribe. If this is a mistake, the user can go to your website and re-optin to receive your newsletters.
